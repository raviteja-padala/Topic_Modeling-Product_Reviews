# Topic_Modeling-Product_Reviews
 
## `1.Project Name:`
   - "Topic_Modeling-Product_Reviews"

## `2. Project Description:`
   - This project aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) and topic modeling techniques to extract valuable insights from product reviews. It involves analyzing customer reviews of various products and identifying key topics or themes discussed in those reviews. This project utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to categorize reviews into meaningful topics, providing businesses with a deeper understanding of customer sentiments and preferences.
   - Topic modeling is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to identify hidden topics or themes in a large collection of text documents. It is a form of unsupervised machine learning that can help organize and understand textual data. Topic modeling aims to discover the underlying topics within a set of documents without any prior knowledge of what those topics might be.

## `3. Problem Statement:`
   - In the era of e-commerce, businesses are inundated with vast amounts of unstructured data in the form of customer reviews. Extracting valuable information from these reviews is a challenging task. The problem is to automatically categorize and summarize product reviews to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## `4. Business Need:`
   - Businesses require a systematic approach to understand customer feedback and sentiments effectively. Extracting topics from product reviews can help identify common customer concerns, strengths, and weaknesses of products, enabling businesses to improve their products and services.

## `5. Project Objectives:`
   - **Topic Modeling:** Implement topic modeling techniques like LDA to categorize product reviews.

## `6. Deliverables:`
   - The project will deliver the following:
     - A web application for extracting and analyzing product reviews in realtime.

## `7. Scope:`
   - The project will focus on product reviews and implement LDA-based topic modeling . It may expand to cover multiple products within the domain.
